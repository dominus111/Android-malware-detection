# Machine Learning for Android Malware Detection Using Permissions
Using different machine learning methods for classifying lightweight apps as malicious or benign based on permissions \
and then comparing the different machine learning algorithms.

## Data set
*[Andro Zoo](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)* \
The data set is composed from lightweight
apks with less than 300 KB, from December 2015 to 2021\
The apks are from Google play store and appchina -
1000 malicious and 1000 benign apks

1. `pip install azoo`

2. create *.az* file in your home directory (~ on Linux 
and macOS, C:\Users\%USERNAME% on Windows) or in the directory where you want to invoke `az` from with the following contents:  
```
key=%API_KEY%  
input_file=%PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE%
```

3. Sample Usage
```
az -n 1000 -d 2015-12-11: -s :3000000 -vt :0 -m play.google.com,appchina
az -n 1000 -d 2015-12-11: -s :3000000 -vt 2: -m play.google.com,appchina
```

## Machine learning algorithms used
1. Support Vector Machine\
2. Random forest\
3. Na√Øve Bayes
## Running
1. Download the Benign and Malware APKs and put them in the corresponding folders \
(I have removed the Malware samples for seurity reasons, but I have left the `data.csv` file with matrix of vectors for playing around)
2. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`\
3. Run `python3 classifiers.py`
